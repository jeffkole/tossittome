Feel free to send pull requests, and I\npromise to be timely in merging them.\n\nAfter making any changes, please verify your work:\n\n  * npm install -g jshint\n  * npm install\n  * ./run-tests\n\nRelease Notes\n=============\n\nMost releases fixes bugs with our mocks or add features similar to the\nactual `Request` and `Response` objects offered by Node.js and extended\nby Express.\n\nv 1.0.3\n-------\n\n  * Merged changes by [invernizzie](https://github.com/invernizzie):\n    to address [#11](https://github.com/howardabrams/node-mocks-http/pull/11)\n\n  * Merged changes by [ericchaves](https://github.com/ericchaves):\n    > I extended your library a little but so it could also handle\n    > some structured responses. By doing so res.send now evaluate the\n    > data passed and search for either a statusCode or httpCode to be\n    > used, and also for a body to send as _data.\n    >\n    > It still working as expected (at least tests passed) for regular\n    > HTTP responses.\n    >\n    > Although I did it with node-restify in mind, it should work well\n    > for all other libs.\n\nv 1.0.2\n-------\n\n  * Added a `.json()` method to the response. (Thanks, diachedelic)\n  * Cleaned up all source files so ./run-tests passes.\n  * Cleaned up jshint issues.\n\nv 1.0.1\n-------\n\n  * Add support for response redirect and render\n\nv 0.0.9\n-------\n\n  * Add support for response cookies\n\nv 0.0.8\n-------\n\n  * Add support for request headers\n  * Fix wrong function name of set cookies\n\nv 0.0.7\n-------\n\n  * Add support for request cookies\n\nv 0.0.6\n-------\n\n  * Add support for request files\n\nv 0.0.5\n-------\n\n  * Fixed a bug where `response.send()` can take two parameters, the\n    status code and the data to send.\n\nv 0.0.4\n-------\n\n  * Added a `request.session` that can be set during construction (or via\n    calling the `_setSessionVariable()` method, and read as an object.\n\nv 0.0.3\n-------\n\n  * Added a `request.query` that can be set during construction and read\n    as an object.\n\nv 0.0.2\n-------\n\n  * Code refactoring of the `Response` mock.\n\nv 0.0.1\n-------\n\n  * Initial code banged out one late night...\n",
